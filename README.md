Frameworks


From a developers perspective, a framework is a standardized coding languages set up in an environment that allows a developer to build a foundation for any development project.


Considering the fact that most websites share similar structures, frameworks are built with the purpose of providing a common foundation structure so that developers can use the code provided instead of starting code from scratch.
