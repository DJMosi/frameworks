Frameworks


From a developers perspective, a framework is a standardized coding languages set up in an environment that allows a developer to build a foundation for any development project.


Considering the fact that most websites share similar structures, frameworks are built with the purpose of providing a common foundation structure so that developers can use the code provided instead of starting code from scratch.

Framework dynamics, How many exist? 

There are two types of frameworks:

1.backend (this is for the logical or unseen backside that makes sites function) 

2.Frontend (the is for the output area or the side that mostly interacts with the user)


It’s important to note that frameworks are in many ways concepts by which the developer can adopt and improve on. according to: "awwwards.com", an organization and site that recognizes and awards the best designes and agencies,"The concept of a framework can be applied to different processes carried out on the web: the programmer’s layer which connects the database to the site content and uses PHP language, and the designer’s layer, where that content must be presented in HTML documents with defined CSS style sheets so it can ultimately be viewed in a browser. They can be backend (a set of files with libraries to access databases, template structures, session management) or frontend. We’re going to focus on frontend frameworks."

Frame works for the frontend/ css frameworks

Frontend frameworks usually consist of a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.)

    The usual components are:
    CSS source code to create a grid: this allows the developer to position the different elements that make up the site design in a simple and versatile fashion.
    Typography style definitions for HTML elements.
    Solutions for cases of browser incompatibility so the site displays correctly in all browsers.
    Creation of standard CSS classes which can be used to style advanced components of the user interface.
